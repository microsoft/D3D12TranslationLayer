# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

Note that this project is used within Microsoft for projects and components which are not open source. As such, changes which would impact those projects, such as changes to function signatures which are leveraged directly, will be subject to additional scrutiny. We welcome bugfixes and additional features which will improve the quality of Microsoft products, as well as other community projects which leverage this one.
